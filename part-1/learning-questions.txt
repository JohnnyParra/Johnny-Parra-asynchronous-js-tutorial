What is the primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous 
programming in JavaScript?
synchronous runs code in a sequence where as asynchronous runs code in parallel.
asynchronous can run an operation while another one is still being processed.

Why is this useful?
It does not freeze the program when waiting for a long action to finish.

What problems does it solve?
stops the program from stopping when waiting for a request to finish. The program can 
do other things and still allow user interaction.
