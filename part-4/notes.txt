Thread - execution of running multiple tasks or programs at the same 
time. Each unit capable of executing code is called a thread. 

main thread - the one used by the browser to handle user events,
render display, and run majority of the code for a typical web page.

if all tasks run on the main thread then a complicated script can 
slow down the entire website.

to get around this we use additional threads to execute independently
while still communication between one another.

this is done with web workers to spin off a sub-program which runs
concurrently with the main thread in a thread of its own. 

this allows slow complex or long-running tasks to be executed 
independently of the main thread to take advantage of modern 
multi-core processors. 

dedicated worker - used by a single script instance.

shared workers - can be shared by several different scripts running 
in different windows.

service workers - caching resources so that web applications can 
work when the user is offline. (key component in Progressive
